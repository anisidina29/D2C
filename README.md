## Overview

This is the official repo for our Design2Code project, maintained by the SALT lab from Stanford NLP. In this repo, we provide: 

- The Design2Code benchmark dataset for the task of converting visual design (screenshot) into code implementation, which consists of 484 real-world webpages from C4 (examples shown below).

- Code for running all automatic evaluation. 

- Code for running multimodal prompting experiments on GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision. 

- Code for finetuning and running inference on our open-source Design2Code-18B model.

## Set Up



## Data and Predictions


## Running Prompting Experiments 

## Running Inference on Design2Code-18B

## Finetuning Design2Code-18B

## Running Automatic Evaluation

## Other Functions

- `data_utils` contains the filtering and processing scripts to construct the test data from C4. 

- `metrics` contains the metric scripts for the evaluation.

- `prompting` contains the code for running all the prompting experiments, including the actual prompts used.

## Acknowledgement

Our testset is filtered from [C4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4), training examples are sampled from [Websight](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceM4/WebSight). Our model is finetuned based on [CogAgent](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVLM). Thanks for their awsome work!
